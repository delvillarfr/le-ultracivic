Ultra Civic pursues an old goal of Ethereum [1 Markets, Institutions, and currencies---A new method of social incentivization]: to finance concrete public goods through ad-hoc seigniorage.

Public good: clean air.
Seigniorage rule: 1 $PR (Pollution Right) awarded to anyone who buys and retires the legal right to emit one ton of CO2.

Legal rights to emit CO2?? Yes. Big polluters in the U.S. and Europe need them, and you can buy+retire them. When you do, polluters can't have them and have to cut emissions by exactly one ton, under government supervision. When you do, you get 1$PR.

## Project Details
Ultra Civic is a simple landing page where people can buy and retire pollution rights, and receive $PR in three clicks.

This iteration is centralized.
- Ultra Civic has pre-purchased 999 pollution rights away from fossil fuel power plants in the Northeastern United States. Users pay Ultra Civic to retire these allowances. Retiring an allowance means never selling it.
- Ultra Civic controls the $PR Treasury.

The next iteration isn't.
- Retired allowances are transferred to an irrevocable trust with the legal mandate to not sell them.
- Anyone can set up third party trusts.
- The treasury has formal governance and issues $PR to whoever deposits a pollution right in any third-party trust.
